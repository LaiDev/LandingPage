# Galactic Pilgrams - Landing Page
## Overview
-
In this project I used Html and CSS to develop a landing page. This landing page is for a fictional clan called Galactic Pilgrams, an online gaming community for the game No Man's Sky. The **purpose** of this landing page is to get games to join Galactic Pilgrams.

### Final  Thoughts 
-
Overall, this project was very fun. It game me an opportunity to imagine a community based around one of my favorite games and to build a website for that community. This project also allowed me to put to the test my knowledge of flex box which I readily used for this website.
