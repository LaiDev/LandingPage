# Galactic Pilgrams - Landing Page

[View Site](https://laidev.github.io/LandingPage/)

## Overview

In this project I used Html and CSS to develop a landing page. This landing page is for a fictional clan called Galactic Pilgrams, an online gaming community for the game No Man's Sky. The **purpose** of this landing page is to get gamers to join Galactic Pilgrams.

### Final  Thoughts 

Overall, this project was very fun. It game me an opportunity to imagine a community based around one of my favorite games and to build a website for that community. This project also allowed me to put to get more familar with flexbox and other CSS properties that I wasn't 100% comfortable with.
