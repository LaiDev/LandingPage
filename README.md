# Galactic Pilgrims - Landing Page

[View Site](https://laidev.github.io/LandingPage/)

## Overview

In this project, I used Html and CSS to develop a landing page. This landing page is for a fictional clan called Galactic Pilgrais, an online gaming community for the game No Man's Sky. The **purpose** of this landing page is to get gamers to join Galactic Pilgrims.

### Final  Thoughts 

Overall, this project was very fun. It allowed me to imagine a community based around one of my favorite games and to build a website for that community. This project also allowed me to get more familiar with flexbox and other CSS properties that I wasn't 100% comfortable with.

#### Next Steps

Make the website responsive on other devices.
